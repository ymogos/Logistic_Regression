 The goal is to build a logistic regression model to classify whether a given iris flower is of the species Iris setosa or not based on its features. The dataset used for this classification task is the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
